# TobyPortfolio
This is Toby Williams coding project portfolio

fridgeCatcher.py and Ultrasonic.py is the code that was made for the 24-hour makeOHI/O competition. It is two of the scripts used in the our system which sensed when someone takes a drink out of the fridge, determine who it is through the opencv facial recognition, and appropriately venmo requests that person.
OnCarCode.ino is code for processing and packaging CAN data on the on-board arduino for the Formula Buckeyes Car.
FallingBabies.cpp is code for a catch falling object game written for a 2-week project last year. I wrote the majority of that code.
LCD_Circle_FinalCode_V2.ino is code for an arduino game puzzle written during last years Escape Room Project Competition.
